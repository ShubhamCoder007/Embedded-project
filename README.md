Object counter project Arduino implementation

Here we have used ultra sonic sensor which was used to sense objects that crosses a particular spot which was being monitored
by the sensor. When it senses the objects it increases the counter and outputs it in the 7 segment LED that was used.

The code which was uploaded in the Arduino UNO microcontroller and the entire implementation was done on it.
